## Zheqiao Chen

Welcome! I’m a master’s student at Columbia University, majoring in Political Science. During my undergraduate years, I developed a strong interest in the interaction between authoritarian governments and their citizens via mass communication. My research interests include political communication, comparative politics, and political methodology.

For a detailed overview of my professional and academic background, please refer to my [Curriculum Vitae](../assets/cv.pdf).

This is my little corner on the web where I document my writings. I’ll be posting here to share my experiences, and I hope you find them helpful or interesting.
