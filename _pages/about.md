## Zheqiao Chen

Welcome! I'm an undergraduate at the [Communication University of China](https://www.cuc.edu.cn/), majoring in public administration with a focus on political communication. During my college years, I developed a strong interest in studying how personal preferences and behaviors are shaped by online information. I'm now applying for graduate school, and am excited to explore this topic further.

For a detailed overview of my professional and academic background, please refer to my [Curriculum Vitae](../assets/cv.pdf).

This is my little corner on the web where I document my writings. I'll be posting here to share my experiences, and I hope you find them helpful or interesting.
