## Zheqiao Chen

Welcome! I’m a master's student at Columbia University, majoring in Political Science. I am interested in how governments and citizens interact through mass communication and the causal impacts on both ends. 

I received a B.A. from [Communication University of China](https://en.cuc.edu.cn/) (2024). For a detailed overview of my professional and academic background, please refer to my [Curriculum Vitae](../assets/cv.pdf).

This is my little corner where I document my writings. I'll be sharing my thoughts and experiences here, and I hope you find them helpful or interesting.
