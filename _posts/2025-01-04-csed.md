A core question in my mind is: What do people know about society and the world? Especially in China, after many years of information control, what do 1.4 billion people see every day?

Previous data and services have several limitations:

1. They usually focus on a single event rather than multiple events.
2. They do not pay much attention to information flow.
3. Data accessibility is a big problem.

Therefore, I think it would be valuable to have a system that monitors the Chinese internet, keeps track of what's happening in China, and aggregates this information at the event level. This is what the CSED (China Social Event Database) does. it monitors the [Weibo](https://weibo.com/) platform, tracks a list of key accounts, automatically aggregates information, and presents social media dynamics on a daily basis.

This project is still in its early stages, and here are a few things I hope to complete in the near future:

1. A comprehensive introduction to its methodology.
2. A user-friendly API for data downloads.
3. Additional features and algorithm adjustments.
